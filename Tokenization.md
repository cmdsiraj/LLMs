# Tokenization
- It is a process of converting either Corpus(Paragraph) or Document(Sentences) in to ***"Tokens"***.
- When we apply **Tokenization** on **Corpus(Paragraph)**, then the **Corpus(Paragraph)** is converted into **Documents(Sentences)**
- When we apply **Tokenization** on **Document(Sentences)**, then the **Document(Sentences)** is converted into **Words**.
- Example:
  ```
  Corpus: "The belief of your mind is the thought of your mind. It is the seed from which your actions grow, influencing how you see yourself and the world around you."
  After applying tokenization, This corpus is converted to sentences. to convert to sentences, the corpus is breaked at special charaters like "." and "!".
  Sentences: 1. "The belief of your mind is the thought of your mind"
             2. "It is the seed from which your actions grow, influencing how you see yourself and the world around you"

  We can also apply tokenization to above sentences. when we apply tokenization to sentences, they gets converted to words. 1. "The", "belief", .....
                                                                                                                            2. "It", "is", "the", "seed",.....
  ```

- ### Vocabulary: Collection of all unique words in a Corpus is called vocabulary.
